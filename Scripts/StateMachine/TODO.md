# Future Architecture Improvements
## Resource-Based State System

 - [ ] Create LocomotionResource class for Walk/Run/Idle configurations
 - [ ] Implement resource-based magic combat system
 - [ ] Design gun system using resource pattern
 - [ ] Create base StateResource class for generic state configurations
 - [ ] Modify StateMachine to accept resource-based states for systems with hundreds of configurations

## Advanced Transition System

 - [ ] Implement conditional property subscription system (locomotion.Velocity.Length <= 8 && someOtherNode.someOtherProperty)
 - [ ] Build reactive framework for complex state conditions
 - [ ] Create expression evaluator for transition conditions

## Visual State Machine Designer

 - [ ] Build editor-based state machine designer
 - [ ] Implement visual transition condition editor
 - [ ] Create framework where state machines can be built entirely in Godot editor without touching code

## Dependency Injection Improvements

 - [ ] Replace temporary export-based dependency resolution with proper DI pattern
 - [ ] Implement "absent minded" parent-to-child data passing system
 - [x] Create initialization phase that propagates top-down instead of relying on Godot's bottom-up _Ready()

## System Reusability

 - [ ] Extend StateMachineController/PlayerInputWrapper for pause menu input handling
 - [ ] Implement game state management using same TransitionHandler pattern
 - [ ] Create menu navigation system using existing input/transition architecture
 - [ ] Design multi-context state machine coordination (character states + game states + UI states)

## Generic State Machine Architecture

 - [ ] Build generic state machine that works with any resource type
 - [ ] Create base classes that can handle arbitrary state counts without node bloat
